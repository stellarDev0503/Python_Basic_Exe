weight = 0.2

# Concatenate a number and a string in one print statement
print(str(weight) + " kg is the weight of the newt.")

# Use format() to print a number and a string inside of another string
print("{} kg is the weight of the {}.".format(weight, animal))

# Use format() to add objects inside a string using index numbers
# (Here we reversed the arguments - just because we could.)
print("{1} kg is the weight of the {0}.".format(animal, weight))

# Use format() to print new objects inside a string
print("{} kg is the weight of the {}.".format(0.2, "newt"))
